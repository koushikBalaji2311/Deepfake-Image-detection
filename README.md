# Deepfake-Image-detection
This repo contains code for training and evaluating a deepfake detection model using EfficientNet-B3 and PyTorch. It classifies images as real or fake, leveraging pre-trained features, data augmentation, and fine-tuning. Outputs predictions in JSON format for easy analysis.
